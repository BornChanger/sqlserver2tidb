# Design Notes

## Control Plane

The migration control plane is GitHub-based. This repository stores low-frequency durable state:

- source cluster profile
- inventory snapshots
- schema conversion output
- migration plans
- export/import state
- CDC checkpoint snapshots
- validation evidence
- approval files

GitHub PRs are used for review and approval.

## PR Draft Generation

The current PR helper is deterministic and local-only. It writes Markdown PR bodies into the metadata tree:

- Cluster-level drafts: `clusters/<source_cluster_id>/prs/<stage>-pr.md`.
- Project-level drafts: `clusters/<source_cluster_id>/projects/<project_id>/prs/<stage>-pr.md`.

Supported stages are `discovery`, `schema`, `plan`, `export`, `import`, `cdc`, `validation`, and `cutover`. The helper records:

- PR title.
- Suggested branch name.
- Files to review.
- Required reviewer roles.
- Approval files when the stage has one.
- Operator checklist.
- Suggested `gh pr create` command.

It does not call the GitHub API, open a PR, merge a PR, or infer approval state.

## Metadata Boundary

Metadata is organized by upstream SQL Server cluster:

```text
clusters/<source_cluster_id>/
```

This is the right boundary for source inventory, SQL Server CDC, source permissions, and worker leases.

Migration projects live below the source cluster:

```text
clusters/<source_cluster_id>/projects/<project_id>/
```

A project represents one independently planned, approved, validated, and cut-over migration unit.

## Schema Draft Generation

The current schema draft generator is deterministic and file-backed:

- Input: `clusters/<source_cluster_id>/inventory/inventory.json`.
- Input: `clusters/<source_cluster_id>/projects/<project_id>/project.yaml`.
- Output: project-local `schema/tidb-ddl/*.sql`.
- Output: project-local `schema/conversion-report.md`.
- Output: project-local `schema/schema-diff.json`.

It filters inventory by the project source database and source schemas. It generates TiDB DDL drafts with rule-based type mappings and marks unsupported or risky source types as manual-review items. It does not connect to TiDB and does not execute DDL.

## LLM Boundary

LLMs may generate:

- compatibility explanations
- schema rewrite candidates
- migration plan drafts
- PR descriptions
- validation report narratives
- incident diagnosis suggestions

LLMs are not required for deterministic repository commands such as `validate-repo`, `discover-sqlserver --dry-run`, `analyze-compatibility`, `generate-schema-draft`, or `generate-pr-draft`. For schema work, the LLM may read `conversion-report.md` and `schema-diff.json` to propose candidate rewrites, but the candidate must be committed as reviewed files before any worker can use it. For PR work, the LLM may refine prose, but file lists, approval files, and stage gates must remain deterministic.

LLMs must not decide:

- whether DDL can run
- whether import can start
- whether CDC has caught up
- whether validation passed
- whether cutover can proceed
- whether destructive cleanup can run

Those gates are handled by deterministic rules, observed runtime state, and GitHub approvals.
